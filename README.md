# Groove Furniture

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Note that for this project, I am using Bun although you can use any package manager you prefer.

Also, I use ClerkAuth for authentication in this project. You can sign up for a free account at [ClerkAuth](https://clerk.dev) and create a new project. After creating a new project, you will be given the api key. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the key.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
